Projects using Guice will have a `Module` class for reach module that will install dependencies.

This installation adds all the `@Provides` methods from external dependencies to the dependency graph at runtime AND NOT at compile time.

`@Inject` -> Guice uses reflection to find these annotations, creates / gets implementation instance, sets field value (amongst other things)
`@Named` -> this is a particular instance of a class. Without it, it would be unclear where / who is injecting this implementation
  - Allows for easily injecting alternate models vs separate classes needing diff types
  - Allows using same interface
`@Provides` -> return value (class) of method annotated
