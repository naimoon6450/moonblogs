I started reading "Inside The Machine" by Jon Stokes and its been a great read so far. He does a great job laying out concepts starting simple and progressively adding complexity.

**Microprocessor = CPU = Central Processing Unit (the file clerk)**
__Contains:__
- ALU => Arithmetic Logic Unit (the clerks calculator)
- Registers => hold state for ALU to do said math (clerks file cabinet)
- Memory (RAM) => separate archive of files located on a different floor

Accessing the registers is almost instantaneous since it's located on the CPU alongside the ALU.

Accessing RAM takes a longer time, since it's not on CPU, but on the Motherboard.

How much faster is register vs RAM retrieval?
- 1 CPU cycle to access register (instant from CPU perspective) -> ~0.3ns -> light travels the distance of my palm in this time
- ~100-200 CPU cycles for RAM access -> ~60-100ns -> light travels the length of a basketball court in this time

So almost 100x slower for RAM access.
