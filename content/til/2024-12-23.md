I've been learning Java recently and its my first time using it in a job setting, so still getting the hang of how certain things work.

We have a company specific IntelliJ plugin that allows us to go from clicking "Generating run configs" to hitting the "Run" button and the project runs:

- It looks at the deployment files for the appropriate app setup (ie. docker image, commands, schedule, among other things)
- Loads any env var + tokens based on scopes
- Builds out the commands to build the actual Java project
- Runs the resulting executable + connects to relevant resources?

It does a bunch of other things as well, but this is definitely a way to ensure a streamlined developer experience for all engineers!
