I'm reading about caching and the difference between temporal and spatial locality.

**Spatial locality**: is the likelihood of accessing memory addresses near recently accessed locations.
- Example: MP3 data has strong spatial locality since you know you're going to need t = 1s and then t = t + 1s (sequential traversal) and so forth as you listen to a track
- Code: related functions living close in memory
- Data: contiguous data structures (ie. arrays)

**Temporal locality** is the likelihood of reusing recently accessed memory locations.
-  Example: simple loops executing over the same data structure repeatedly (ie. games, photoshop filter, etc.)
- Code: hot paths being executed frequently (ie. game loop, event handlers)
- Data: frequently accessed state (ie. LRU cache)

Using a media player as a case study:
- It has good spatial locality as we're sequentially reading the audio/video frames
- It has mixed temporal locality:
  - High code (decoder runs continuously)
  - Low data (frames usually processed once)

Keeping the above in mind could help make better decisions while:
- choosing data structures
- understanding data access patterns
