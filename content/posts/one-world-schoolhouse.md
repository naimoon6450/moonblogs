The One World School House by Sal Khan is an incredible analysis of the state of our education system in the United States. Sal recounts how Khan Academy came to be, its mission, and how it can potentially transform the world. Moreover, he discusses why our current education system is failing us due to archaic and arbitrary decisions made by the people in power at the time.

So many decisions made that have impacted generations of students and the way they navigate the world. Decisions such as learning subjects in isolation, 45-minute class periods, homework, and exam content are key things Sal brings into question. 

As I was reading the book, I couldn't help but recall the kind of student I was and my experience within the public education system. Being a first-generation college student, I didn't have many mentors growing up, which led me to make poor decisions that led to a cascade of bad habits. Even beyond mentors, not having the resources or knowledge to get on the right track made things more difficult. 

From elementary school to college, I floated through the education system without a strategy or plan. Imagine playing Tetris with the mindset "I'll place these pieces wherever I like" as opposed to actually knowing the rules and clearing the rows. You may end up with  something like the following:

What you see is a knowledge foundation full of gaps that lead to a difficult time ahead. I hope to shed some light on my journey and how my perspective shifted from one filled with blame to one full of empathy and growth.

In elementary school, I was too busy distracting other kids and chatting up a storm about Pokemon and Digimon. Books were noise, homework was a chore, teachers were pedants, and games were my escape. Instead of learning the basics of arithmetic, I was busy scheming a new plan to get my parents to buy a new game or a booster pack of Yu-Gi-Oh cards. Granted I was a kid and this was fine, but I didn't enjoy learning. My teachers would complain to my parents during parent-teacher conferences, but it didn't change my attitude. All this led to the first defining moment in my life, a middle school entrance exam. Years of making bad decisions and not having the proper guidance culminated in a brittle knowledge base and failure was inevitable.

I ended up transferring to a better middle school and that's where I met my first mentor. Mr. Ratzon, my 8th-grade math teacher, ignited a fire in me. Finally, someone who believed in me and wanted me to reach my full potential. He was an incredibly passionate and kind teacher. One of the rare few who was able to convey the beauty of math simply and relate it to the real world. He saw my potential and nurtured it. This was the first time I felt like I was good at something and received positive feedback to help build my passion into something bigger. Just as Sal Khan fostered Nadia's love for math, Mr. Ratzon fostered mine. A mentor, in any capacity, is crucial for igniting passions and providing a sense of direction. Whether it's a parent, a sibling, a caring friend, or a tutor, having someone with whom you can speak and share your thoughts is pivotal for intellectual development. This is reinforced by the [field research done](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2019/10/popular-economicsciencesprize2019-2.pdf) by Nobel Prize winners Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee. They found that targeted support (via a mentor or teaching assistance) for students has a strong impact on their educational outcomes. Sal preaches this throughout his book, calling for the role of a teacher to evolve into more of a mentor who guides students through their personalized learning journey.

This all led to the next defining moment in my life, the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). Even though I went to multiple tutoring programs I was unable to get into my dream high school. My mind was elsewhere during tutoring. I cared to do the work to some extent, but something was inherently missing. Every tutoring session was the start of a countdown. I wasn't self-motivated, but rather, pushed by my parents to constantly "do better" without any guidance on how to do it. We'd be compared to "smarter" individuals in the community and expected to magically follow what they were doing. The comparisons were the inception of an ongoing imposter syndrome that would fuel into adulthood.

In any case, I ended up going to a non-specialized high school and thrived. Math and Science were the main priorities, but everything else unfortunately took a backseat. The ongoing struggle with the humanities persisted and the knowledge gaps grew bigger. My reading comprehension and critical writing ability were elementary. On top of that, my ever-shrinking knowledge of history slowly narrowed my perspective of the future. The one light at the end of the humanities tunnel was my Creative Writing class. I was finally able to express my thoughts without judgment. My teacher, Ms. Lustbader, fostered my creativity and encouraged me to bring my love for math and physics into the writing sphere. Around the same time, my sister was into the arts and exposed me to Salvadore Dali's work. One piece caught my eye and was the subject of my college essay. I wrote about how Newton's laws of motion were summoned within "Living Still Life". Somehow, the universe plucked me by the head and decided I would be going to Columbia University.

A first-generation college student somehow makes his way to Columbia University. The last two decades did not prepare me for what was to come. Concepts that came naturally to others were difficult for me. Forget concepts, I didn't know what office hours were until Sophomore year. Perhaps I was thrusted into an environment I didn't belong. The tetris holes surfaced in a variety of ways. Whether it was through a lack of participation, inability to write a proper essay, or using the same old brute force methods to solve problems, the gaps were evident. Don't get me wrong, I worked hard, but I didn't know how to work smart. In retrospect, I could have put in more hours, but I'm not sure if this would have been productive effort given the state of my mind at the time. From being on a dance team to to trying to make my first relationship work, I had a bit of a bumpy start to college.

Having said all that, I am grateful for the people that I met, the concepts learned, and the endless opportunities for my future. To some degree, every individual I interacted with at Columbia served as my mentor. The accomplishments and drive of every student pushed me to be better whether I liked it or not. That being said, I, and many others like myself, were going through the college maze without a map while a lot of our peers had maps, guides, and a compass.

After graduating from university, my mind was free from the shackles of problem sets, exams, and competition. I
